<h3 class="about">Features</h3>

A real-time weather app using RESTful API calls and local storage

* OpenWeather API
* Store Favorite Cities using Angular Local Storage
* Routing
* One button calls both the current-weather API and the 5-day forest API
* User can search by city name or zip code: app detects the type of input and forms API call accordingly
* The Same city is not saved multiple times
* The "Save City" button is disabled if there is no city to save

<h3 class="about">Tecnical Notes</h3>

This was a personal experiment to build up my Angular skills.

* Integrates third-party weather icons, mapping the OpenWeather codes to the appropriate icons
* Modifies the incoming weather data for ease-of-coding in the markup
* Implements routing
* Uses Angular Resource rather than $http
* Implements AngularJS components instead of controllers
* Roboto-Bold
